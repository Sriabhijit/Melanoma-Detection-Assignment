# Melanoma-Detection-Assignment
## Problem statement: 
To build a CNN-based model that can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma can potentially reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here?
  > Building a CNN-based model that can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
  > A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma can potentially reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
  > The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
  > The base model we built performs well on the training dataset but poorly on the testing data, indicating overfitting.
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
  > The model has not improved as significantly as expected. The accuracy of the model has also decreased. While there are slight improvements after increasing model complexity and adding augmentation, they are not substantial.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
  > After adding 500 images to each class, applying data augmentation, and increasing the model complexity, we have significantly improved the model's performance and accuracy.
